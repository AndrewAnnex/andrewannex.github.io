Laboratory analysis of these samples back on Earth would provide important constraints on the petrologic history, aqueous processes, and timing of key events in Jezero crater. However, interpreting these samples requires a detailed understanding of the emplacement and modification history of the Maaz formation. Here we synthesize rover and orbital remote sensing data to link outcrop-scale interpretations to the broader history of the crater, including Mastcam-Z mosaics and multispectral images, SuperCam chemistry and reflectance point spectra, RIMFAX ground penetrating radar, and orbital hyperspectral reflectance and high-resolution images. We show that the Maaz formation is composed of a series of distinct members corresponding to basaltic to basaltic-andesite lava flows. The members exhibit variable spectral signatures dominated by high-Ca pyroxene, Fe-bearing feldspar, and hematite, which can be tied directly to igneous grains and altered matrix in abrasion patches. Spectral variations correlate with morphological variations, from recessive layers that produce a regolith lag in lower Maaz, to weathered polygonally fractured paleosurfaces and crater-retaining massive blocky hummocks in upper Maaz. The Maaz members were likely separated by one or more extended periods of time, and were subjected to variable erosion, burial, exhumation, weathering, and tectonic modification. The two unique samples from the Maaz formation are representative of this diversity, and together will provide an important geochronological framework for the history of Jezero crater.","tags":["Mars","Jezero","M2020","Maaz"],"title":"Mineralogy, morphology, and emplacement history of the Maaz formation on the Jezero crater floor from orbital and rover observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Lewis, K.W.","Koeppel, A.H.D.","Edwards, C.S."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684281600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684281600,"objectID":"1756fa475a5adad5a8748ad4ee561d11","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/arabia_two/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arabia_two/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Layered rocks in the Arabia Terra region of Mars preserve a record of the planet’s ancient climate. However, the exact formation mechanism of these rhythmically layered deposits is currently unknown. We previously proposed two distinct regionally correlative units of the Arabia Terra layered deposits based on their bedding thicknesses, orientation, and morphology from HiRISE stereo observations. For this work, we selected two adjacent craters in Arabia Terra, Sera and Jiji, for further study to test the proposed stratigraphic correlation. We constructed vertical stratigraphic sections of the deposits from dip-corrected bed thickness measurements and local stratigraphic correlations. We found that individual beds maintain a consistent thickness over kilometer scales but are somewhat variable at the basin scale. Each crater exhibited strata with a thinning-upward trend that terminated at terraces with inconsistent bedding possibly indicating an equilibrium elevation for the formation mechanism. We also identified a probable stratigraphic correlation between basins using the similarities in bedding characteristics and patterns of measurable differences in bed-to-bed thicknesses, indicating synchronous strata. The planar bedding and uniform thickness of the beds within the deposits is consistent with airfall deposition over a prolonged geologic period. This process likely occurred under comparably dry conditions relative to previously proposed depositional and diagenetic formation mechanisms.","tags":["Mars","Arabia Terra","ELD","Layered Deposits","HiRISE","Correlations","Geomodeling"],"title":"Bedding scale correlation on Mars in western Arabia Terra","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quantin-Nataf, C.","Alwmark, S.","Calef, F.J.","Lasue, J.","Kinch, K.","Stack, K.M.","Sun, V.","Williams, N.R.","Dehouck, E.","Mandon, L.","Mangold, N.","Beyssac, O.","Clave, E.","Walter, S.H.G.","Simon, J.I.","admin.","Horgan, B.","Rice Jr., James W.","Shuster, D.","Cohen, B.","Kah, L.","Sholes, Steven","Weiss, B.P."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684281600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684281600,"objectID":"073d8763276f4604e8bc3283d07e247e","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/complex_exhumation/","publishdate":"2023-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/complex_exhumation/","section":"publication","summary":"During the first year of NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, Perseverance rover has investigated the dark crater floor unit of Jezero crater and four samples of this unit have been collected.

Then, we investigate the impact crater density distribution across the floor unit. It reveals that the crater density is heterogeneous from areas which have been exposed to the bombardment during the last 3 Ga to areas very recently exposed to bombardment. It suggests a complex history of exposure to impact cratering. We also display evidence of several remnants of deposits on the top of the dark floor units across Jezero below which the dark floor unit may have been buried. We propose the following scenario of burying/exhumation: the dark floor unit would have been initially buried below a unit that was a few tens of meters thick. This unit then gradually eroded away due to Aeolian processes from the northeast to west, resulting in uneven exposure to impact bombardment over 3 Ga. A cratering model reproducing this scenario confirms the feasibility of this hypothesis. Due to the complexity of its exposure history, the Jezero dark crater floor unit will require additional detailed analysis to understand how the Mars 2020 mission samples of the crater floor can be used to inform the Martian cratering chronology.","tags":["Mars","Jezero","M2020"],"title":"The Complex Exhumation History of Jezero Crater Floor Unit and its implication for Mars Sample return","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paar, G.","Orter, T.","Tate, C.","Deen, R.

Documenting the rock and soil characteristics across the crater floor is critical for establishing the geologic context of Perseverance’s cached samples – which will eventually be returned to Earth – and for interpreting the deposition and modification of the Máaz and Séítah formations. Mastcam-Z, a pair of multispectral, stereoscopic zoom-lens cameras, provides broadband red/green/blue and narrowband visible to near-infrared images (VNIR, 440-1020 nm). From multipsectral observations from sols 0-380, we compiled a database of ∼2400 representative Mastcam-Z spectra. We analyzed principal components, spectral parameters and laboratory spectra of pure minerals and natural rock surfaces to interpret the spectral diversity of rocks and soils. We define eight spectral classes of rocks: Dusty, Hematite-like, Coated, Low-Ca Pyroxene-like, Olivine-like, Weathered Olivine-like, Fe-rich Pyroxene-like, and Dark Oxide-like. The variability of soil spectra in the Jezero crater floor is controlled primarily by the amount of dust and indicates a largely consistent soil mineralogy across the traverse, with the exception of the area disturbed by the landing event. In comparison to rock spectra from the Curiosity rover’s Mastcam instrument in Gale crater, rocks on the Jezero crater floor are generally less spectrally diverse, but the Olivine-like rocks within the Séítah formation represent new spectral classes in Mars surface exploration.","tags":["Mars","M2020","Perseverance","Mastcam-Z"],"title":"Spectral variability of rocks and soils on the Jezero crater floor: A summary of multispectral observations from Perseverance’s Mastcam-Z instrument","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koeppel, A.H.D.","Edwards, C.S.","admin","Lewis, K.W.","Carrillo, G.J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640304000,"objectID":"23aab837a5470f2569e2d2db90e3816f","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/dry_arabia/","publishdate":"2021-12-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dry_arabia/","section":"publication","summary":"The light-toned sedimentary layers that outcrop widely throughout Mars’ Southern Highlands have long been an enigma in uncovering the climatic history of Mars. Although these units seem to contain unique records of fluctuating surface conditions, the role of water in their formation is debated. A distinctive property of many such deposits is their elevated thermal inertia relative to that of surrounding materials. This temperature-controlling trait is often interpreted to  indicate induration resulting from aqueous processes. However, prevalent erosional landforms suggest that the deposits host much weaker materials than neighboring units. We address this apparent contradiction by disentangling the relationships between thermal inertia, mineralogy, and erosion susceptibility and by quantifying the cohesion of layered deposits in the Arabia Terra region. We demonstrate that variations in dust cover associated with relative erodibility and eolian abrasion can be inconspicuous controls on apparent thermal inertia. We ultimately find that these deposits are not as cohesive as would be expected from a high water-to-rock ratio setting either during or after deposition. If water-rich surface conditions existed in the region after the Noachian, these deposits suggest they may have only been intermittent and fleeting.","tags":["Mars","Arabia Terra","Layered Deposits","Thermal Inertia"],"title":"A fragile record of fleeting water on Mars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elizabeth M.

However, several outstanding questions remain regarding the connectivity of plume material to the ocean and the composition of the complex organic material. Herein we introduce Tiger, a mission concept developed during the 2020 Planetary Science Summer School at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Tiger is a flyby mission that would help further constrain the habitability of Enceladus through two science objectives: (1) determine whether Enceladus's volatile inventory undergoes synthesis of complex organic species that are evidence for a habitable ocean, and (2) determine whether Enceladus's plume material is supplied directly from the ocean or if it interfaces with other reservoirs within the ice shell. To address the science goals in a total of eight flybys, Tiger would carry a four-instrument payload, including a mass spectrometer, a single-band ice-penetrating radar, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, and an imaging camera. We discuss Tiger's instrument and mission architecture, as well as the trades and challenges associated with a habitability-focused New Frontiers–class flyby mission to Enceladus.","tags":["Enceladus","PSSS","Mission Concept"],"title":"Tiger: Concept Study for a New Frontiers Enceladus Habitability Mission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abigail M.

This bold mission of exploration would orbit an ice-giant planet to study the planet, its rings, small satellites, space environment, and the planet-sized moon Triton. Triton is a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt, twin of Pluto, and likely ocean world. Odyssey addresses Neptune system-level science, with equal priorities placed on Neptune, its rings, moons, space environment, and Triton. Between Uranus and Neptune, the latter is unique in providing simultaneous access to both an ice giant and a Kuiper Belt dwarf planet. The spacecraft—in a class equivalent to the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini spacecraft—would launch by 2031 on a Space Launch System or equivalent launch vehicle and utilize a Jupiter gravity assist for a 12 yr cruise to Neptune and a 4 yr prime orbital mission; alternatively a launch after 2031 would have a 16 yr direct-to-Neptune cruise phase. Our solution provides annual launch opportunities and allows for an easy upgrade to the shorter (12 yr) cruise. Odyssey would orbit Neptune retrograde (prograde with respect to Triton), using the moon's gravity to shape the orbital tour and allow coverage of Triton, Neptune, and the space environment. The atmospheric entry probe would descend in ∼37 minutes to the 10 bar pressure level in Neptune's atmosphere just before Odyssey's orbit-insertion engine burn. Odyssey's mission would end by conducting a Cassini-like ''Grand Finale'', passing inside the rings and ultimately taking a final great plunge into Neptune's atmosphere.","tags":["Neptune","Mission Concept"],"title":"Neptune Odyssey: A Flagship Concept for the Exploration of the Neptune–Triton System","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" As many open source developers recently found, Travis CI has stopped providing their service to the open-source community for free. There have been many other blog-posts, a long hacker-news thread, and tweets about the state of open-source development that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to repeat here. However, there are some trends and possibilities that I have observed and have not seen discussed widely, so here I go talking to the void.\nGithub workflows saved the day (Anecdotally, or at least just for me) CI/CD is not a new concept, but arguably Travis CI popularized CI/CD for open source projects by being early and very easy to integrate with Github. I selected Travis CI when developing SpiceyPy; it had a fun logo, and it was straightforward to get working. Upon hearing the news about Travis CI, I switched to GitHub workflows, and anecdotally so did many other developers (my sources are mostly Tweets and hacker news comments). I will be curious to see metrics to back this up, but there are many other ci services out there (cursory checks of Google trends did not reveal anything clear), so maybe the impact of Travis departing the FOSS world did not shake things up that much.\nUnintended Consequences of Travis CI changes I was able to translate my Travis CI YAML steps into an equivalent Github workflow very quickly. So quickly that I was able to unify my Windows CI builds into the GitHub workflow allowing me to stop using the Appveyor service. I should also note that I started using Appveyor more than five years ago, so I was ignorant of more recent moves Appveyor made to support other operating systems or other CI services making similar moves. To be fair to Appveyor, the service worked very well for me for years, and it was free, but the urge to have a singular YAML file was too strong (more on this soon).\nOne YAML (syntax) to rule them all I was also impressed by how flexible the Github workflow syntax was. For years, I maintained two similar yet incompatible YAML files for Appveyor and Travis that were both repeating the same logic with service-specific YAML syntax. Unifying those files was very satisfying from a DRY perspective, but it led to a broader question that motivated this blog-post: What truly differentiates the various CI services other than their specific configuration quirks? I am sure there are financial and ease of use trade-offs for enterprise customers, but consider just for the moment the simple Python projects not requiring Docker containers or higher-level orchestration of some kind. The CI workers\u0026rsquo; requirements for these small projects are relatively minimal as they just need to run a few bash commands. The different CI services had slightly different YAML syntax, as they didn\u0026rsquo;t adopt a standardized way to implement the common logic. Theoretically, as some of these services open-sourced various aspects of their infrastructure, one service or the other could have adopted one style or another. Since Github workflows are open source (you can self-host runners), maybe that could become a standard. But paradoxically, if the CI services embrace a standardized YAML syntax, what incentive remains for users to continue using their service over another? It would seem to remove a large portion of the core engineering business to outsource this core infrastructure component.\nVertical integration and Vendor lock-in The vendor lock-in move GitHub is making with workflows is apparent, and the other CI services simply do not have the same amount of eyeball time that GitHub gets for open source projects like mine. Thankfully, there are some mitigating facts that, for now, should keep the space competitive. First, Git is open source, and there are other free hosted Git services out there with their own CI integration, GitLab notably. Second, GitHub open-sourced their workflow action runner code allowing self-hosted runners with an MIT License. Other CI services could theoretically use the runners or modify their infrastructure to use the GitHub YAML syntax. The only issue I would see is that I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a published schema/spec/API versioning of the GitHub YAML syntax out there. In any case, nothing is stopping some other CI service from attempting to standardize their particular YAML for additional services to use.\nIn short, GitHub workflows allowed me to quickly switch CI services in a way that fit well into my current daily usage of GitHub for my projects. Many posts I have seen about the fall of Travis CI have discussed worrying trends in the open-source world. Still, I don\u0026rsquo;t think enough attention has been paid to the rippling effects of a large, diversified competitor entering a market filled with smaller players who are not their own cloud provider. I think that many of the smaller services will have to make moves to ensure they remain relevant. I doubt they can differentiate themselves for long with greater performance/more parallel jobs. The rise of ARM could make things a bit interesting as some CI services have native runners to offer up, but it seems like that is also a surmountable service for larger vendors to offer. I doubt GitHub\u0026rsquo;s CI offering would be attractive enough to switch GitLab users over, but it also seems the reverse is more likely if Microsoft decides they need to decrease their generosity. To be clear, I think GitHub/Microsoft would totally be in the right to do so, but I think that move would be poorly received. Maybe concerns over lock-in will raise the issue of CI workflows\u0026rsquo; transportability to the point a community standard is adopted, but I could also just overemphasizing the difficulty of rewriting a YAML file once every few years.\nThanks for reading this meandering post. Maybe this was all extremely obvious to everyone, but you decided to keep reading to this point, so what does that say then? If I am just wrong about something or unaware of some trend, please reach out and let me know, nicely.\n-Andrew\n","date":1609430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609430400,"objectID":"37e5b375a58130ef2f5485f0e717a9e1","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/post/fall_of_travis_rise_of_gh/","publishdate":"2020-12-31T12:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/fall_of_travis_rise_of_gh/","section":"post","summary":"As many open source developers recently found, Travis CI has stopped providing their service to the open-source community for free.

Ames Stereo Pipeline (aka ASP) is an open-source stereo photogrammetry toolkit that helps users take stereo image pairs and produce DEMS from them using a command-line interface (CLI). However, the process involves a large number of steps that are tedious to run and can lead to mistakes or lost work. Automating the workflow to produce a DEM reduces the risk of human errors and also makes the results reproducible.\nThe asp_scripts project, written in pure bash, was the first open-sourced effort to automate the workflow of creating DEMs for CTX and HiRISE images, and ASAP-Stereo is an expansion and reimplementation of that project into python. By using python, ASAP-Stereo provides a more flexible version of the asp_scripts workflow. ASAP-Stereo implements the individual steps in the asp_scripts workflow as discrete functions to allow advanced users to fix issues as they occur without redoing work, while also providing higher-level functions that call the steps serially to reproduce the workflow.\nThe most exciting contributions of ASAP-Stereo are the Jupyter notebook based workflows to enable reproducibility. The notebook workflows contain all the logs for each step of the process, and the parameters used to create the DEM with embedded images of intermediate products. The notebook logs allow users to, at a glance, judge the outputs of ASP and make changes as needed or to distribute the full log in the supplementary material for a publication.\nASAP-Stereo is powered primarily by the sh package, which turns any program on the user\u0026rsquo;s path into a python function, python fire, which turns any python function or class into a CLI, and by the papermill project which turns Jupyter notebooks into runnable workflows. This mixing of python and bash allows ASAP-Stereo to mix the two with minimal scaffolding, gaining the benefits of both. For example, ASAP-Stereo uses GDAL programs to pass parameters to another CLI tool of mine called Moody to use a REST API supported by the PDS Geosciences Node to download the subset of MOLA PEDR data needed to align the CTX dem to MOLA topography.\nOther neat features include the incorporation of new feature-matching based point cloud alignment that makes the process of aligning HiRISE products to CTX a bit more robust and detecting the CPU cores and threads to speed up particular bottlenecks in the stereo process. ASAP-Stereo also uses other features in Moody to automatically determine the \u0026ldquo;left image\u0026rdquo; (most nadir) in a stereo run and the correct Ground Sample Distances (GSDs) to use.\nThat said, there are some things that ASAP-Stereo does not do. It does not make ASP accessible to beginners. ASAP-Stereo targets users who have advanced knowledge of ASP and ISIS3 due to sheer complexity and caveats involved. Deployment is difficult due to the complexity of ASP and ISIS3, which also prevents integration tests for the project. Planned changes for ISIS3 may enable this in the future.\nBy open-sourcing the project, I hope to see improvements to existing workflows as well as new workflows contributed by users. ASAP-Stereo provides an excellent framework to implement workflows for other instruments such as LRO NAC and HRSC. I also hope to present ASAP-Stereo at future workshops, and I plan to make the project citeable soon.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":1592452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592452800,"objectID":"72f44a36d921a3abe40e4ceb5d2977db","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/post/asapstereo/","publishdate":"2020-06-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/asapstereo/","section":"post","summary":"Today I have open-sourced ASAP-Stereo, which I developed to automate the Ames Stereo Pipeline and to make Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of HiRISE and CTX stereo pairs reproducible for my research.

This plugin changes the new-tab behavior in chrome to display a beautiful picture of the Earth from one of Planet\u0026rsquo;s orbital assets (SkySats, Doves, and Rapideye) in the new tab along with a short description of the image. Also, if you click the small globe in the corner, the image would change.\nHowever, a while back, I have switched to using Firefox as my primary browser. So I haven\u0026rsquo;t had these nice images to view.\nBefore, I wondered how hard it would be to port the plugin to Firefox given that extensions for Firefox and Chrome can be code-compatible.\nAs it turned out, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t difficult at all.  So for those that have developed extensions for Chrome and Firefox, this will be totally unsurprising and uninteresting. But, it was fun for me, having never looked into extension development before. And it only took me about an hour of tinkering to get it working. Below I detailed the steps I followed, and I\u0026rsquo;ve posted a WIP PR (work in progress pull request) to the Github repository for the chrome extension to point out how easy it was to get it working.\nIn any case, I am back to having beautiful new tabs!\nSteps The first step was to get the source code for the extension, which is available on Github.\nOkay, that was easy\u0026hellip; So I follow the readme to produce a zip archive of the built extension.\nNext, I used Firefox to install the plugin from the archive file as a temporary plugin. This step revealed an error in the manifest file related to the \u0026ldquo;incognito\u0026rdquo; parameter not being supported in Firefox.\nEmploying the methodology of \u0026ldquo;changing things and seeing what happens\u0026rdquo;, I fixed the issue by changing the mode from \u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;not_allowed\u0026rdquo;. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t know why Firefox would not implement \u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo;, or at least allow to override to prevent it from breaking extensions (possibly discussed in detail here).\nAfter that, the extension installed. Everything worked.\nI then followed some steps to make an account at Mozilla to get the extension signed. This allowed me to sign the extension so I could install it permanently.\n","date":1587873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587873600,"objectID":"08342e3f03f1288fe9059c24c87c5ceb","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/post/planet_view_firefox/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/planet_view_firefox/","section":"post","summary":"One of my favorite plugins for Google Chrome was the Planet View extension from Planet (formerly known as Planet Labs).

explanatory, we will import spiceypy, numpy, and matplotlib to get started.\nimport spiceypy import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline  Step 3: Load the kernels okay now we can actually use spiceypy to load the kernels using the furnsh command on the metakernel file, this will load the kernels into the kernel pool for us to use.\nspiceypy.furnsh('./msl_v23_120807_160806.tm')  let\u0026rsquo;s check to see how many kernels we loaded\nspiceypy.ktotal('ALL')  120  Step 4: Use SpiceyPy to get the longitude and latitude of the rover through time we will pick a time range from August 8th 2012 to August 1st 2016, which is around 1450 days. I will use linspace to enumerate 4350 times between these times so that I will definitely have at least 1 position per sol. Remember, Mars sols are slightly longer than 24 hours. Finer time steps are likely possible but that would require a huge query or more targeted queries surrounding known traverses.\nsol0 = spiceypy.str2et(\u0026quot;2012 AUG 08 00:00:00.000 UTC\u0026quot;) sol1450 = spiceypy.str2et(\u0026quot;2016 AUG 01 00:00:00.000 UTC\u0026quot;) times = np.linspace(sol0, sol1450, num=1450*3, endpoint=True) len(times)  4350  great, lets grab the positions using spkpos in SpiceyPy\npositions, lttimes = spiceypy.spkpos(\u0026quot;MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY\u0026quot;, times, \u0026quot;IAU_MARS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lt+s\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MARS\u0026quot;) len(positions)  4350  now we need to convert it to lon lat, let\u0026rsquo;s go with planetocentric\nr, lon, lat = np.array([spiceypy.reclat(p) for p in positions]).T lon *= spiceypy.dpr() # you could also just use numpy.degrees for this... lat *= spiceypy.dpr()  Great, so let\u0026rsquo;s make a simple map to show the traverse.

I will be using the USGS Astrogeology center\u0026rsquo;s map layers hosted by ESRI for basemaps. I\u0026rsquo;ve included the shaded MOLA+HRSC topography layer, the global CTX mosaic layer, and the uncontrolled (more on this in a bit) HiRISE mosaic layer. Note that there is a significant (hundred+ meters) miss-alignment between where the MSL positions are plotted in longitude and latitude from the HiRISE basemap. This is due to the basemap of hirise being produced as a \u0026ldquo;uncontrolled\u0026rdquo; mosaic so the placement of the images is not exact. I expect that the position of the rover in longitude and latitude is more correct as the spice kernels I used are from the PDS archive.\nimport folium tiles='https://astro.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/OnMars/MColorDEM/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}' m = folium.Map(location=[-4.7, 137.35], zoom_start=11, max_zoom=18, tiles=None, crs='EPSG4326') folium.TileLayer( max_native_zoom=7, tiles=tiles, attr='usgs/esri', crs='EPSG4326' ).add_to(m) ctx = folium.raster_layers.TileLayer( tiles='https://astro.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/OnMars/CTX/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}', max_native_zoom=12, attr='usgs/caltech', name='ctx', opacity=1, overlay=True, control=True, crs='EPSG4326' ) ctx.add_to(m) hirise = folium.raster_layers.TileLayer( tiles='https://astro.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/OnMars/HiRISE/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}', max_native_zoom=17, attr='usgs/esri', name='hirise', opacity=1, overlay=True, control=True, crs='EPSG4326' ) hirise.add_to(m) # add points from positions utc_times = spiceypy.et2utc(times, 'C', 0) folium.PolyLine(list(zip(lat, lon)), color='green').add_to(m) for i, (lo, la) in enumerate(list(zip(lon,lat))[::10]): folium.Marker((la, lo), tooltip=f'{utc_times[i]}').add_to(m) folium.LayerControl().add_to(m) m   ","date":1586970000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586970000,"objectID":"8f0aa20fdcd139f32c69249a6c91facc","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/post/spiceypy_msl_example/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T12:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/spiceypy_msl_example/","section":"post","summary":"Using SpiceyPy to map the Curiosity rover (MSL). note: Here is a link to a gist jupter notebook of this tutorial\nIn this post, I provide a worked out tutorial for using my library SpiceyPy and some of the standard python libraries to make a map of the Curiosity Rover (Mars Science Laboratory) position on the surface of Mars for a number of years.\nStep 1: getting kernels I am interested in MSL\u0026rsquo;s movements from landing in 2012 to 2016, so I used this PDS tool to download the kernel list I need from 2012-08-07 to 2016-08-06 at https://naif.","tags":null,"title":"Using SpiceyPy to map the Curiosity rover (MSL)","type":"post"},{"authors":["admin","Ben Pearson","Benoît Seignovert","Brian Carcich","Helge Eichhorn","Jesse Mapel","Johan von Forstner","Jonathan McAuliffe","Jorge del Rio","Kristin Berry","K.-Michael Aye","Marcel Stefko","Miguel de Val-Borro","Shankar Kulumani","Shin-ya Murakami"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582243200,"objectID":"8edf8340d73fdcaa071c168ea077a427","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/spiceypy/","publishdate":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spiceypy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Python","Spice","Space","FOSS"],"title":"SpiceyPy: a Pythonic Wrapper for the SPICE Toolkit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Lewis, K.W."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577923200,"objectID":"7580e2eee333f2370145efe53bcf6ce3","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/arabia_one/","publishdate":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arabia_one/","section":"publication","summary":"In the mid-equatorial region of Arabia Terra, Mars, dozens of moderately-sized impact craters (10-100 km diameter) contain layered sedimentary deposits. Previous work has found that these layers are resolvable at the meter scale and that they are quasi-periodic in expression. However, the interrelationships of these deposits, along with their formative depositional process, has not yet been determined. Proposed formation mechanisms include fluvio-lacustrine deposition, groundwater upwelling and evaporation, and aeolian or distal volcanic air-fall. For this study, we measured layer thicknesses from stereo image-derived topography within nine craters. We find two regionally extensive layered units with characteristic average bed thicknesses of 12 and 3.5 meters, and a possible third unit of intermediate thickness. Each unit was identified in a number of craters forming regionally consistent groups. These proposed units represent the first regional correlations of isolated sedimentary deposits in Arabia Terra and point to blanketing regional deposition over at least two separate geologic periods.","tags":["Mars","Arabia Terra","ELD","Layered Deposits","HiRISE","Correlations"],"title":"Regional Correlations in the layered deposits of Arabia Terra, Mars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nixon, C.A.","Ansty, T.M.","Lombardo, N.A.","Bjoraker, G.L.","Achterberg, R.K.","admin","Rice, M.","Romani, P.N.","Jennings, D.E.","Samuelson, R.E.","Anderson, C.M."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573430400,"objectID":"d99a529a3419b6bec4e23275a2906bdf","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/cirs/","publishdate":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cirs/","section":"publication","summary":"From 2004 to 2017, the Cassini spacecraft orbited Saturn, completing 127 close flybys of its largest moon, Titan. Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), one of 12 instruments carried on board, profiled Titan in the thermal infrared (7–1000 μm) throughout the entire 13 yr mission. CIRS observed on both targeted encounters (flybys) and more distant opportunities, collecting 8.4 million spectra from 837 individual Titan observations over 3633 hr. Observations of multiple types were made throughout the mission, building up a vast mosaic picture of Titan’s atmospheric state across spatial and temporal domains. This paper provides a guide to these observations, describing each type and chronicling its occurrences and global-seasonal coverage. The purpose is to provide a resource for future users of the CIRS data set, as well as those seeking to put existing CIRS publications into the overall context of the mission, and to facilitate future intercomparison of CIRS results with those of other Cassini instruments and ground-based observations.","tags":["Python","Space","Cassini","CIRS","Titan"],"title":"Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) Observations of Titan 2004-2017","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Frontier Development Lab is a highly competitive research ~10 week internship experience held at SETI in Mountain View California each summer.

I am mapping the layers in HiRISE images that I am also producing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) which cover relatively large areas of Mars at 0.25 cm per pixel resolution. Mapping the deposits by hand is tedious busy work, and is distracting from the science I want to accomplish. To accelerate the mapping of these layered deposits, in 2018 I developed a training data set from layers I had already mapped and trained a U-Net architecture Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automate the process. Specifically, the CNN was trained on 1 meter per pixel normalized HiRISE images, so it would not rely on the elevation models to map my layers, and was provided many true negative examples of other similar surface features such as linear dunes which were not desireable to map. Traditional computer vision techniques need to be more deeply investigated, but as there is a large number of criteria that I use when mapping the layers that would be difficult to quantify, using a neural network allows me to quantify my expert knowledge implicitly from the training data. I presented an abstract and talk about this work at the 2018 NASA Goddard AI Workshop.\n","date":1542377527,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542377527,"objectID":"75aa0fc5306fc5c6ca2fe952be9ade22","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/project/deeplayermapper/","publishdate":"2018-11-16T10:12:07-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/deeplayermapper/","section":"project","summary":"UNet to map Mars","tags":["machine-learning","deep-learning","Mars","Arabia Terra","HiRISE","AI"],"title":"Deep Layer Mapper","type":"project"},{"authors":["Burrell, AG","Halford, A","Klenzing, J","Stoneback, RA","Morley, SK","admin","Laundal, KM","Kellerman, AC","Stansby, D","Ma, J"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542326400,"objectID":"179bfb340a5d8658548476e25d9490b6","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/publication/snakes/","publishdate":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snakes/","section":"publication","summary":"Computational analysis has become ubiquitous within the heliophysics community. However, community standards for peer review of codes and analysis have lagged behind these developments. This absence has contributed to the reproducibility crisis, where inadequate analysis descriptions and loss of scientific data have made scientific studies difficult or impossible to replicate. The heliophysics community has responded to this challenge by expressing a desire for a more open, collaborative set of analysis tools. This article summarizes the current state of these efforts and presents an overview of many of the existing Python heliophysics tools. It also outlines the challenges facing community members who are working toward the goal of an open, collaborative, Python heliophysics toolkit and presents guidelines that can ease the transition from individualistic data analysis practices to an accountable, communalistic environment.","tags":["FOSS","Python","Space"],"title":"Snakes on a Spaceship—An Overview of Python in Heliophysics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Although SpiceyPy is my largest public python package, this blog post will be about two smaller, but conceptually important projects that I have started that I think present some interesting concepts for the planetary science community.\nBoth of these tools are Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) that are built upon the excellent python package \u0026ldquo;python-fire\u0026rdquo;. Fire is able to produce a rich command line utility from the existing functions in a python file or class, with essentially no additional code other than the import for fire and a single function call. Fire also grants you options like dropping into a REPL and tab completion. This from my view would be sufficient for most use cases I have and have seen. Alternatives like \u0026ldquo;argparse\u0026rdquo; which is built-in to python requires a lot more work and another package called \u0026ldquo;click\u0026rdquo; is popular I just do not need access to the additional functionality. In short, I am able to write functions into a class and directly expose them with fire with essentially no additional code, and after uploading to pypi users can get access to this functionality in their terminals or use the same code as a python package.\nMoody The first tool, \u0026ldquo;moody\u0026rdquo;, provides a minimal interface to the Mars ODE REST api through the command line so that simple meta-data queries and provides commands to download HiRISE and CTX EDR images by partial product id. While HiRISE EDR products consist of several .IMG files, they are relatively easy to download using wget. In moody the command would look like:\nmoody hirise-edr PSP_001810_1825*  However CTX images are not able to be downloaded using the same trick as they are separated by data volumes, but by using the ODE I am able to query for the correct url without much work. Meta-data can be easily retrieved by running:\nmoody get-ctx-meta P19_008442_1899*  And if I am only interested in a single field the emission angle can be retrieved by:\nmoody get-ctx-meta-by-key P19_008442_1899* Emission_angle  At the moment, the functionality for moody is fairly use-case focused, but my hope is that it will grow as more meta-data query use-cases are contributed. In any case, for users that want to perform programatic queries to the ODE, moody provides a template to build upon. My hope is that this tool will be useful for people who know a hirise or ctx product id, but just need to do quick lookups of meta-data without opening a web browser and having to click and scroll some page for the info.\nCirc My newest tool, \u0026ldquo;Circ\u0026rdquo;, attempts to construct reasonable mosaics using CTX images over a provided bounding box. This came out of a need to look at large areas of Mars where the existing CTX mosaic in Google Earth does not cover. It currently does this by first selecting the CTX images that intersect the user provided bounding box, and then selects images with low emission angles (which is configurable by the user). This is what the command looks like:\ncirc make-vrt 136.0 -7.0 139.5 -3.5 --name gale --em_tol 1.0  Here I am making a mosaic over Gale crater and I am limiting the emission angles to be no greater than 1.0 degrees to keep things consistently nadir.\nThen the collection is sorted by emission angle and area, and the foot prints are then intersected in a cascade operation so that footprints that almost completely overlap previous footprints are excluded. This reduces the total number of images needed to cover the area to a high degree, and then a similar reduction is then performed by stochastically sampling the collection to further reduce the number of images needed. This is a cheap way to get to good-enough results to what I think is something similar to a packing problem that I am sure is more elegantly solved elsewhere, but from what I have tested so far this works pretty well.\nOnce the minimal set of images have been selected, the pre-computed pyramided geotiffs provided by the \u0026ldquo;ASU Mars Space Flight Facility\u0026rdquo; are then downloaded in parallel to a folder, and a GDAL VRT is built from the tiffs in that folder. In brief, VRTs are xml files that can point to multiple data sources readable by GDAL that can be local or remote, and then gdal treats the resulting vrt file as a single data source that can then be read directly by other GDAL powered applications like QGIS. For more on VRTs this blog post explains it with more detail. This results in an instant mosaic that can be viewed in QGIS, and then further gdal operations can create a single flat geotiff mosaic to save disk space. Here is a zoom in to the gale mosaic I made using the circ command above displayed in QGIS overlaying the MOLA shaded-colorized topography map:\n\nAs you can see there is a pretty large gap by the Dulce Vallis and Farah Vallis markers, looking at the available images it looks like an image with an emission angle of around 2 degrees was excluded, but this is because I asked for images with equal to or less than 1 degree. Otherwise the results are usable. And of course if you needed to add an image to a VRT or remove one, you would simply update the folder containing all of the downloaded geotiffs and re-run gdalbuildvrt. A thing that is missing from Circ at the moment is the ability to histogram match the images to make the overlaps less obvious, but that is something I hope can either be contributed or eventually I will get to it if there is not some other existing utility or function in QGIS or gdal that can do it.\nConclusion In my first long blog post, I have discussed two CLI tools I have built for the martians of the planetary science community. I hope they prove to be useful! At the top I alluded to there being interesting concepts for the planetary community, and if I had not made it clear then I should say that it would be a great thing if more members and made their work available in command line tools. Spending a little time to polish them up makes these utilities better for your own use and will benefit the community as a whole if they are made available.\n","date":1515362013,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515362013,"objectID":"6873392d02764ded60e75ad494f6f153","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/post/moody-and-circ/","publishdate":"2018-01-07T16:53:33-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/moody-and-circ/","section":"post","summary":"Although SpiceyPy is my largest public python package, this blog post will be about two smaller, but conceptually important projects that I have started that I think present some interesting concepts for the planetary science community.\nBoth of these tools are Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) that are built upon the excellent python package \u0026ldquo;python-fire\u0026rdquo;.

Layered rocks are essential to planetary scientists because the layers can preserve a record of the climate that describes the history of the planet. The presence of layered rocks alone tells us that some re-occurring process produced the different layers, and these processes can involve liquid water. Knowing the precise details about the activity of liquid water on Mars are one of the scientific community\u0026rsquo;s biggest unanswered questions. By investigating layered rocks, in a variety of locations and interpreting their geologic record, we can piece together the larger story of water on Mars.\nLayered Deposits in Arabia Terra Geography on Mars is a bit different from the Earth due to the lack of plate tectonics and oceans. A broad region near the equator and prime meridian called Arabia Terra contains many old impact craters containing layered deposits within their interiors. If you have read the book or seen the movie The Martian by Andy Weir, Arabia Terra is the region the character Mark Watney drives across (no spoilers). These layered deposits, in particular, are interesting because they may have formed by lakes or playas within the craters fed by groundwater. I also officially named a few of these craters with The Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature through my first paper.\nPotential climate signals rocks record On the Earth, layered rocks are formed by the deposition of sediment to form sedimentary rocks. As these layers accumulate, they each say something about the environment in which they were created, and in particular, the time they were formed. Layered rocks serve as a literal record of geologic events, much like tree rings record a tree\u0026rsquo;s history. These rock records describe the history of the planet they were formed on. This principle underpins geology and is how we have learned the geologic history of the Earth. In particular, understanding how the layers were formed is critical to know what the record is telling you. So if we can figure out how these layered deposits were formed, we can figure out what the climate of Mars was like when they were created and how it may have changed through space and time.\nHiRISE is amazing To study these layered rocks, I need to get close. Unfortunately, the rovers on Mars are busy elsewhere. Instead of looking at these rocks from the surface (in-situ being the term), I use satellite images from a camera called HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment). HiRISE is onboard the Mars Reconnnasaince Orbiter spacecraft and images the surface at about a quarter meter per pixel resolution. This resolution is comparable or better than what is commercially available on the Earth, at least until fairly recently. Thanks to this high resolution, I can clearly see these layered deposits in Arabia Terra. Although to properly study these deposits, a single picture is not enough to answer how the layered deposits were formed.\nSemi-Automated Stereo Photometry with the Ames Stereo Pipeline However, suppose I can get two carefully planned images as a stereo pair. In that case, I can make a digital elevation model (DEM) of the surface. This process is called stereophotogrammetry or computer stereo vision. It can produce an elevation dataset at a similar high resolution to the images used. However, HiRISE images are large, and stereo processing can take lots of time and manual effort. To solve this problem, I used open-source software provided by NASA called the Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP). ASP automates much of the tedious work required to make a DEM. Through my Ph.D. I have developed a toolset that further automates ASP to make HiRISE DEMs called ASAP (Ames Stereo Automated Pipeline). I describe ASAP in a separate section of my site, and it is hosted on my GitHub. In the end, I can produce high-quality DEMs of the layered deposits in a reproducible manner.\nImportance of elevation data Elevation data is critical for studying these layered deposits as it is a massive information dimensionality increase from a single image. A lot of geology is possible from a single image. However, quantitative answers to questions about layer thickness and directionality (orientation) are tough without elevation data. From the elevation data, we can visualize and measure the geometry of the layered deposits. We can determine how these layered deposits were formed from this geometry information by comparing the geometry with deposits studied on the Earth. We also gain a record of each layer\u0026rsquo;s geometry and can see how these layers changed through time. The changing properties through time describe how each layer\u0026rsquo;s formation varied and can, in turn, tell us how climate conditions on Mars changed.\nDeep Layer Net (see other project for more) First Paper tl;dr ","date":1474035068,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474035068,"objectID":"68f2b71f62121af1adbf8e33d029629a","permalink":"https://andrewannex.com/project/arabiaterrastratigraphy/","publishdate":"2016-09-16T10:11:08-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/arabiaterrastratigraphy/","section":"project","summary":"Ph.D. Dissertation at JHU","tags":["machine-learning","deep-learning","Mars","JHU"],"title":"Regional Stratigraphy of Arabia Terra","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to my blog!

This paper presents GeoMesa, a distributed spatio-temporal database built on top of Hadoop and column-family databases such as Accumulo and HBase, that includes a suite of tools for indexing, managing and analyzing both vector and raster data. The indexing techniques use space filling curves to map multi-dimensional data to the single lexicographic list managed by the underlying distributed database. In contrast to traditional non-distributed RDBMS, GeoMesa is capable of scaling horizontally by adding more resources at runtime; the index rebalances across the additional resources. In the raster domain, GeoMesa leverages Accumulo's server-side iterators and aggregators to perform raster interpolation and associative map algebra operations in parallel at query time. The paper concludes with two geo-time data fusion examples: using GeoMesa to aggregate Twitter data by keywords; and georegistration to drape full-motion video (FMV) over terrain.","tags":["GeoMesa","BigData","GeoSpatial","NoSQL","Accumulo","HBase","geodatabase"],"title":"GeoMesa: a distributed architecture for spatio-temporal fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In 2013 I was an intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) working with Dr. Conor Nixon on the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument science team.
