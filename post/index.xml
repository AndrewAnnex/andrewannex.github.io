This plugin changes the new-tab behavior in chrome to display a beautiful picture of the Earth from one of Planet&amp;rsquo;s orbital assets (SkySats, Doves, and Rapideye) in the new tab along with a short description of the image. Also, if you click the small globe in the corner, the image would change.</description></item><item><title>GitHub action-based blogging</title><link>https://andrewannex.com/post/actions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://andrewannex.com/post/actions/</guid><description>So, if you can read me, I have successfully used github actions to deploy my hugo built blog from a private repository to my public github pages site.
Why?
for fun I guess&amp;hellip; but automating things that typically take a few steps by hand is fun and I never was a fan of the whole mulit-branch github pages workflow.</description></item><item><title>Using SpiceyPy to map the Curiosity rover (MSL)</title><link>https://andrewannex.com/post/spiceypy_msl_example/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andrewannex.com/post/spiceypy_msl_example/</guid><description>Using SpiceyPy to map the Curiosity rover (MSL). note: Here is a link to a gist jupter notebook of this tutorial
In this post, I provide a worked out tutorial for using my library SpiceyPy and some of the standard python libraries to make a map of the Curiosity Rover (Mars Science Laboratory) position on the surface of Mars for a number of years.
Step 1: getting kernels I am interested in MSL&amp;rsquo;s movements from landing in 2012 to 2016, so I used this PDS tool to download the kernel list I need from 2012-08-07 to 2016-08-06 at https://naif.</description></item><item><title>Moody and Circ</title><link>https://andrewannex.com/post/moody-and-circ/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 16:53:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andrewannex.com/post/moody-and-circ/</guid><description>Although SpiceyPy is my largest public python package, this blog post will be about two smaller, but conceptually important projects that I have started that I think present some interesting concepts for the planetary science community.
Both of these tools are Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) that are built upon the excellent python package &amp;ldquo;python-fire&amp;rdquo;. Fire is able to produce a rich command line utility from the existing functions in a python file or class, with essentially no additional code other than the import for fire and a single function call.</description></item><item><title>First</title><link>https://andrewannex.com/post/first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:30:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://andrewannex.com/post/first/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog!
