      <description>Although SpiceyPy is my largest public python package, this blog post will be about two smaller, but conceptually important projects that I have started that I think present some interesting concepts for the planetary science community.
Both of these tools are Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) that are built upon the excellent python package &amp;ldquo;python-fire&amp;rdquo;. Fire is able to produce a rich command line utility from the existing functions in a python file or class, with essentially no additional code other than the import for fire and a single function call.</description>
